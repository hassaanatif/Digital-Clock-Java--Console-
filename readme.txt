Description: This basic digital Calender is capable of handling many edge cases (including time values exceeding their limits, or input time being less than zero). 
It can also handle leap year based on a boolean value. Months contain the same number of days as they do in real life (unless specified otherwise by the user). 
This calculator can also handle new year, and last but certainly not least, this calculator has a different subscript for different sets of days. For example: 
1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th etc...
